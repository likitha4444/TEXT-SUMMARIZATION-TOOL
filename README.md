# Project Documentation
# GenAI Text Summarizer

## Overview

GenAI Text Summarizer is a powerful and flexible text summarization tool that leverages generative AI models. The application allows users to input text through various methods, including typing, file uploads (PDF, DOCX, text files), and audio recordings, and generates concise summaries of the input content. This project is designed with a modular structure to ensure scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Enter text directly into the application for summarization.
- **File Upload**: Upload text files, PDF documents, or DOCX files for summarization.
- **Audio Input**: Record or upload audio files which are transcribed and summarized.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive web interface powered by Gradio for easy interaction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/likitha4444/genai-text-summarization.git
    cd genai-text-summarization
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.env\Scripts\activate`
    ```
